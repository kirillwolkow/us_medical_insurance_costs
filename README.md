# US Medical Insurance Costs

Hello and welcome!

I'm a student of Codecademy. Currently I'm doing the 'Data Analysis' Career Path. For the course I finished this project, called "US Medical Insurance Costs" in which I made some calculations/findings.:

You can open the project with a jupyter notebook.

I'm happy for every feedback I get! To be more precise, here are some questions:

Is my finding about the age of people with at least 1 child correct?
Any recommandations for learning statistics/math (I'm pretty bad at it).
Thank you for everything in advance!

PS: sorry for my english, I'm swiss.
